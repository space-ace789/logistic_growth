The data used to create these models was from experiment.csv is attached under the same name to this git repository. The data was originally sourced from OSF and was created on 22nd September 2023.mmm

Plotting the Data: 

The analysis began by simply plotting time against the population size of the *E. coli* This produced an S shaped curve which suggests the bacterial population is growing via logistic growth. This is when you initially have exponential growth, before slowing and becoming more linear as you reach the carrying capacity, once at carrying capacity growth stops and the population is expected to remain constant if all else remains equal. The result is that at small populations and early in time very little change in population happens, however this quickly turns into rapid increase in population around intermediate values of t and population size before tailing off at high population sizes, was shown in the plots produced by the code in plot_data.R.
